### Final project introduction

Wow! You've made it all the way to the end of course for System Administration and IT infrastructure services. Congratulations. We've covered a lot of material in this course and hopefully you've expanded your IT skill set to now be able to support small organization of hundred users and machines. Let's take a moment to recap what you've accomplished so far. You learn about the many many responsibilities involved in Systems Administration. Whether that role is as system admin or an IT support specialist, it includes lots of important tasks. These can be anything from figuring out IT organizational policies like setting pass requirements to running the hardware lifecycle provisioning hardware for users, to maintaining software for a fleet of machines, or working with users and flexing your troubleshooting skills. On top of that, System Administration responsibilities also include managing IT infrastructure services. We cover the various IT infrastructure services that make up in organizations IT environment. You learn about physical infrastructure services like working with server hardware and virtual servers along with how to access those services using remote connection methods. You also learn about the various network services involved in the organization and why DNS and DHCP are essential to a company. You've reviewed software services and the differences between using software on a personal and commercial setting. You even learn about the different communications software used in the industry along with vital services like fast storage and printing. You also covered common platform services, and how web service function. The last IT infrastructure service that you learned about was directory services. We covered centralized management of accomplish uses and IT assets. You also learned about dial up and go hands on with two of the most popular directory services. Active Directory and open dial up. Finally, you learned how to protect your organization's data in the case of a disaster. You learned how to back up critical data, create a disaster recovery plan, pick up the pieces after disaster struck and learn from it by creating a post-mortem. Now, it's time to put your newly acquired knowledge to the test. You'll assess the IT infrastructure of three fictitious but very real life based companies, and provide Systems Administration consultation. Make sure to think about some of the best practices you learned about like data backup, cost benefit analysis, service to enable or disable, and more. Good luck on your assessment and I know you got this.

### Alex passion success

\[MUSIC\] My name's Alex Franklin. I started at Google in 2004 as a support specialist, what we called a field tech back then. Now I'm an operations manager, sort of still dealing with IT. Back then, I questioned myself. Why am I doing this? But I stuck with it because I loved it, because I had the passion for it. I mean it was something that I valued eventually. After school, I went into the military. And in the service, when I first started learning HTML, it was something nobody else knew, nobody else in my unit knew. It was new, there were no real books on it. I didn't know why I wanted to learn it, but I did. Just by digging in there, rolling up my sleeves, and tackling it head on. And not being scared off by whatever stood in front of me. Being in this field, pushing myself in technology, continuing to deal with the challenges and overcoming them, continuing to grow and learn, this has helped me and my family. Helped us financially. It's helped us with satisfaction in life. It's helped turn my kids into little technologists. And kind of set the course for them in what they see themselves doing in the future.
